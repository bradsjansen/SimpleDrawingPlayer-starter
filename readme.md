## Task :
Add an additional tool (and all its underlying functionality) to make an Oval tool that plays a different sound!
## Steps:
1. Add a button to the tool bar, by examining how it's currently done for all the other buttons, and then duplicating that functionality.
2. Add a tool class that implements the new button by looking at how the ShapeTool class works
3. Add a class that implements the new shape by looking at how the Shape class works
